# Motivation

WAMR has a large amount of nice features, but we don't have a home to introduce these yet. A blog system would be a great choice, it will have such advantages:

- SEO friendly, which may attract more people to see our GitHub page
- Write freely, write everywhere. It's not a formal document and everyone can write something here
- Give us a knowledge base of the design from both Intel teams and external contributors
- Be the entrepot of our articles and we can forward to other social medias

## Blogging solution

I've spent a lot of time to decide which tool/framework to use in our blogging system since there are so many solutions. These major factors are taken into consideration:

1. Satisfy most people's writing habits
2. Full control of our data, don't rely on commercial storage service
3. No billing
4. Customizable, we can decide the layout and style of our blog

I investigated some modern blog tools and frameworks and made a comparison here:

|     |  Hugo  |  nextjs  |  ghostjs  |  gitbook  |
| :---: | :---:  |  :----:  |  :----:   | :---: |
| description | static site generator(SSG) tool | react SSR & SSG framework | Content Management System | commercial content hosting service |
| self host | âˆš | âˆš | âˆš | X |
| tech stack | Go/JavaScript | JavaScript | JavaScript | - |
| customizable | High | High | High | Low |
| **need backend?** | No | Yes(No if pure SSG)  | Yes | - |
| **deploy** | GitHub pages | server | server | provided service |
| effort | theme + configure | JavaScript development | little | little |

- *Gitbook* is eliminate, since it's designed for documents and hard to do customization
- *Nextjs* is eliminate, since it need some development effort
- As for *hugo* and *ghostjs*, *hugo* wins ðŸŽ‰ because it doesn't need a backend and can be hosted on GitHub pages, the github CI will deploy it automatically.

## Writing experience with Hugo

- Git based version control
- pull request based workflow
- Manage content by path
- Use markdown format
- Live preview during writing
- You can embed raw HTML inside markdown, so there is no limitation (e.g. add a video)

<style>
iframe {
  aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
</style>

# ðŸ‘€ Now let's see how to write a blog

## Folder structure

``` bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ archetypes                      # used by hugo, no need to care
â”œâ”€â”€ assets                          # used by hugo, no need to care

```

## Working flow

## Command line

git clone https://xujuntwt95329/wamr_blog.git
cd wamr_blog
hugo new content/en/blog/<article_name>/index.md

gh pr create
```

## Decisions

    <input type='checkbox'> Should we put bytecodealliance logo in the home page?</input><br/>
    <input type='checkbox'> Should we create separate repo to maintain the blog?</input><br/>
    <input type='checkbox'> We use an open-sourced theme called Doks with MIT license, is it OK?</input><br/>
    <input type='checkbox'> The `Docs` link will redirect to our gitbook once its finished.</input><br/>
